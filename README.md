<h1>Japan Travel Guide site with Firebase Auth & Firestore</h1>
<!-- /TITLE -->

<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->
This app was built with HTML, Materialize CSS and JavaScript on the frontend and Firebase Auth & Firestore is used as the backend.

The purpose of this app was to build a project that allowed users to login and for different types of users (i.e. admin users vs. regular users) have different User Interfaces as well as different site priveleges.

Anyone is free to create an account with an e-mail address, password and a one-line bio. Once logged in, the regular users can see the posts on the site.

Admins, however, are super-users who have the ability to:

1. Make posts for the site.
2. Make regular accounts into admin accounts. (Admins have access to a form that allows user input of an e-mail address).

Test admin login:
username: admin@admin.com
password: superuser

If you'd like to see the regular user view, feel free to make an account!
